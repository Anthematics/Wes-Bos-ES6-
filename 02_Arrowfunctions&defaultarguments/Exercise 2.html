	// 1. Given this array: `[3,62,234,7,23,74,23,76,92]`, use the array filter method and an arrow function to create an array of the numbers greater than `70`
	const numbers = [3, 62, 234, 7, 23, 74, 23, 76, 92];

	const greater = numbers.filter(num => num > 70)
	console.log(greater)
// .filter will keep only numbers that fit the bill
// first num = getting the number  => arrow runs a function which is essentially an if statement (if num is > than 70 than it is true and you console.log it)
