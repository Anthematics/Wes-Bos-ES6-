    <title>DESTRUCTURING STUFF</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
   //instead of const first = person.first const last=person.last etc
   //we can do const {first , last ,twitter } this removes the need for so many lines of code.
   //it says "give me the variable first , last , & twitter and take that variable from the person" this takes those properties and puts them in variables.
    
    const person = { 
        first: 'Jason',
        last: 'Harder',
        country:'Canada',
        city: 'Toronto',
        //twitter:'@anthematics',
    
    };

//destructuring allows us to extract data from arrays , objects maps & sets into their own variables.    
    const { first, last, city } = person;

// I only allow first last twitter & city here so typing country into console comes back undefined.

// so often times (like when you return information from an API - it is pretty deeply nested like in the example below.)

const jason = { 
    first: 'Jason',
    last: 'Harder',
    links: {
        social: {
            twitter: 'https://twitter.com/anthematics' ,
            github: 'https://github.com/Anthematics/',
            facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/Anthemantics'
        },

        web:{
           website:'www.hireharder.com'
        }
    }
}

// old way of saving the twitter const is <const twitter = jason.links.social.twitter>
//old way of saving web const is is <const web = jason.links.web.website but again thats alot of lines of code
// BETTER METHOD BELOW 

const { twitter:tweet, facebook:fb, github:gh} = jason.links.social; 
//^^^^^^this will reach into the social object and grab the 3 social links.

//we can also set defaults - so imagine we will be creating an element and styling it.

const settings = {width: 300, color: 'black'} //height , fontsize 
const {width = 200 , height = 50, color = 'green', fontSize = 25 } = settings; 
// as it is currently set it will  pick out width and color from settings so it will go
// to the default of 50  for height & black for color. 
//-> width is destructured so it will be 300 , height is not so it will be fiddy (50) 


//object destructuring w/ variable renaming & default values.
//in this final case we would get width 2 of 800 because 
//it is destructuring width from the object on the right (w: 800) and renaming it
// renaming it to width2

//when height comes into play it will ALSO try to destructure from the (w:800) object
// but it wont be able to so it keeps it's default value.
const {w: width2 = 500, h: height2 = 250} = {w: 800}
