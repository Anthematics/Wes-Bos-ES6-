    let inRing= 'Hulk Hogan'
    let onSide = 'Dwayne Jhonson a.k.a The Rock'

//so they need to tag eachother I.e Hulk goes on side and the rock is in ring

// inRing = onSide won't do it as they'll both asssign to one variable (the rock in this case)
// used to make a temp variable which would look like (below)

// var tmp = inRing;
//inRing = onSide;
//onSide = tmp; 

//now we can do something different using descructuring
//which looks like the example directly below

[inRing, onSide] = [onside,Inring];

//this creates an array and descrutures into opposites -> we use let since we will be upadating these variables.
